# BigDataTask

During solving given task, i was wondering about some aspects (which i feel were undefined)
- the output path - I've chosen to give directory on which is created project,
- I didnt use external library to join but to some other actions I did, I have no idea if I was allowed to do so,
- the command which was used to execute funtion - was it in specyfic language or general command which can be modyfied with symbols like: "()" (depending on preogramming language) 

Final code is placed in pull request as asked.
